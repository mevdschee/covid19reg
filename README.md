# COVID-19 attendance registration

![recording](images/recording.gif)

This is a simple COVID-19 attendance registration tool that can be used at any venue (sports club, churche, restaurant, bar, etc.). The tool has multiple themes (color sets) and contains multiple languages.

## Why should I use this tool?

This tool registers attendees at your venue and is the mobile-friendly QR-code based digital equivalent of paper registration ballots that you can hand-out and collect in a closed box. If somebody happens to get COVID-19 and this person was at your venue, this tool will help you contact the people that might have been exposed.

## How about privacy?

In short: the tool stores the answers (email address or phone number) in daily files on your web server. These files are automatically overwritten after a month. It is designed in a way that only the system administrator has access to this data.

## Dependencies

The tool requires PHP 7. The QR-code is generated by: https://github.com/kazuhikoarase/qrcode-generator.
